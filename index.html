            <p class="body"> Hello! My name is Cory Dunstan and I am from Avon, Ohio. This is my first attempt at a portfolio, as well as my first major coding assignment. I currently sell life insurance from home but am looking for a change of pace involving the tech-industry. 
                <br><br>I have always been interested in technology-- be it phones, computers, or video games. Most of my experience comes from jailbreaking and rooting cellphones back in highschool. I used to make custom ROMs for the Samsung Galaxy S4 and upload them to the xda developer website. It has been awhile since I have been involved with custom software. 
                <br><br>However, I am currently enrolled in Case Western Reserve's coding bootcamp and am looking to get back in touch with my roots and expand my talents beyond that of a simple after-school hobby; hopefully into a full-time career! </p>
